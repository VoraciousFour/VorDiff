## Introduction

Automatic differentiation is a tool for calculating derivatives using machine accuracy. It has several advantages over traditional methods of derivative calculations such as symbolic and finite differentiation. Automatic differentiation is useful for calculating complex derivatives where errors are more likely with classical methods. For instance , with finite differentiation, h values that are too small will lead to accuracy errors though floating point roundoff error, while h values that are too large will start making vastly inaccurate approximations. 

Automatic differentiation is useful due to its practicality in real world applications that involve thousands of parameters in a complicated function, which would take a long runtime as well as strong possibility for error in calculating the derivatives individually. 

Our package allows users to calculate derivatives of complex functions, some with many parameters, allowing machine precision.
