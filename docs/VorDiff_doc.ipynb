    "# Milestone 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is a tool for calculating derivatives using machine accuracy. It has several advantages over traditional methods of derivative calculations such as symbolic and finite differentiation. Automatic differentiation is useful for calculating complex derivatives where errors are more likely with classical methods. For instance , with finite differentiation, h values that are too small will lead to accuracy errors though floating point roundoff error, while h values that are too large will start making vastly inaccurate approximations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is useful due to its practicality in real world applications that involve thousands of parameters in a complicated function, which would take a long runtime as well as strong possibility for error in calculating the derivatives individually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our package allows users to calculate derivatives of complex functions, some with many parameters, allowing machine precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially automatic differentiation works by  breaking down a complicated function and performing a sequence of elementary arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as elementary functions like exp, log, sin, etc. These operations are then repeated by the chain rule and the derivatives of these sequences are calculated. There are two ways that automatic differentiation can be implemented - forward mode and reverse mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule makes up a fundamental component of auto differentiation. The basic idea is:   \n",
    "For univariate function, $$ F(x) = f(g(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $$F^{\\prime} = (f(g))^{\\prime} = f^{\\prime}(g(x))g^{\\prime}(x)$$\n",
    " \n",
    "For multivariate function, $$F(x) = f(g(x),h(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial g} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For generalized cases, if F is a combination of more sub-functions,  $$F(x) = f(g_{1}(x), g_{2}(x), â€¦, g_{m}(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial g_{i}} \\frac{\\partial g_{i}}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For F is a function f(g): f: $R^n$ -> $R^m$ and g: $R^m$ -> $R^k$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{J}_{\\mathrm{gof}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{J}_{\\mathrm{g}}(\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})) \\mathbf{J}_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J(f) =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial x_{1}}} & {\\cdots} & {\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial x_{n}}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial x_{1}}} & {\\cdots} & {\\frac{\\partial f_{1}}{\\partial x_{n}}} \\\\ {\\vdots} & {\\ddots} & {\\vdots} \\\\ {\\frac{\\partial f_{m}}{\\partial x_{1}}} & {\\cdots} & {\\frac{\\partial f_{m}}{\\partial x_{n}}}\\end{array}\\right]$ is the Jacobian Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Auto Differentiation: Forward Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward mode automatic differentiation is accomplished by firstly splitting the function process into one-by-one steps, each including only one basic operation. It focuses on calculating two things in each step, the value of scalar or vector x in $R^n$, and the 'seed' vector for the derivatives or Jacobian Matrix. From the first node, the value and derivatives will be calculated based on the values and derivatives of forward nodes. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic differentiation is superior to analytic or symbolic differentiation because it could be computed on modern machines. It is also superior to numerical differentiation because numeric method is not precise but AD deals with machine precision problems properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of computational graph and table for forward mode AD is shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  f\\left(x,y\\right) =\\sin\\left(xy\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We will be evaluating the function at $f(1, 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation trace:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Trace   | Elementary Function      | Current Value           | Elementary Function Derivative       | $\\nabla_{x}$ Value  | $\\nabla_{y}$ Value  |\n",
    "| :---: | :-----------------: | :-----------: | :----------------------------: | :-----------------:  | :-----------------: |\n",

    "### 2.3 Reverse Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse mode automatic differentiation has a process similar to the forward mode auto differentiation, but has another reverse process. It does not apply the chain rule and only partial derivatives to a node are stored. First, for the forward process, the partial derivatives are stored for each node. For the reverse process, it starts with the differentiation to the last node, and then activations in the forward process are deployed in the differentiation step by step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Forward Mode v.s. Reverse Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main aspects can be considered when choosing between Forward and Reverse mode auto differentiation.\n",
    "* Memory Storage & Time of Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward mode needs memory storage for values and derivatives for each node, while the reverse mode only needs to store the activations of partial differentiation to each node. The forward mode do the computation at the same time as the variable evaluation, while the reverse mode do the calculation in the backward process.\n",
    "* Input & Output Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input dimension is much larger than output dimension, then reverse mode is more attractive. If the output dimension is much larger than the input dimension, the forward mode is much computational cheaper."

    "## How to use VorDiff\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Automatic Differentiation package is called VorDiff. The two main objects you will interact with are `AutoDiff` and `Operator`. In short, the user will first instantiate a scalar variable as an `AutoDiff` object, and then feed those variables to operators specified in the `Operator` object. The `Operator` object allows users to build their own functions for auto-differentiation. Simple operations (e.g. addition, multiplication, power) may be used normally. More complex functions (e.g. log, sin, cos) must use the operations defined in the `Operator` class. Lastly, the user may retrieve the values and first derivatives from the objects defined above by using the `get()` method.\n",

    "The `ReverseVector` class allows a vector of multiple user defined variables capable of reverse mode of automatic differentiation. The `ReverseVector` objects contain two hidden attributes, `._val` and `._gradient`. The attribute `._val` and can be retrieved with the `get()` method. The partial derivatives with respect to the user defined variables can be retrieved by just calling the attribute `._gradient` of the objects. The dunder methods are also implemented in this class so that user can do the basic reverse mode computation and operations with the objects."

    "### 1. Option for higher-order derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of ways we could improve our package. The first is to grant users the option to compute higher-order derivatives like Hessians. We can recursively apply AD first to the target function, i.e., producing the first-order derivative, then moving the operations of the first-order derivatives into a new computational graph then applying AD again. In short, higher order derivatives would be accomplished by repeatedly applying automatic differentiation to function and its derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Application using AD library to find the roots of functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A second way we could extend our work is by writing a separate library to find the roots of given functions. For example, this could include an implementation of Newtonâ€™s Method that calculates the exact Hessian matrix of a function using AD to get second-order partial derivatives. We would use Newton's Method to search for the approximations by calculating the exact Hessian matrix of the function using AD to get the second-order partial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Backpropagation in neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also extend our implementation of automatic differentiation to the neural networks. Neural networks are able to gradually increase accuracy with every training session through the process of gradient descent. In gradient descent, we aim to minimize the loss (i.e. how inaccurate the model is) through tweaking the weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "By finding the partial derivative of the loss function, we know how much (and in what direction) we must adjust our weights and biases to decrease loss. In that series, we calculate the derivative mean squared error loss function of a single-neuron neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computers to calculate the partial derivatives of an expression in neural networks, we can implement the automatic differentiation for both forward pass and back propagation. Then we can calculate the partial derivatives in both scalar and vector modes.\n"
